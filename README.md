# Restaurant-Page

This is a project created for TheOdinProject which teaches:
1. Webpack
2. Single Responsibility Principle

It uses JS to remove content of a page and replace it with different content which is generated based on a code places in separate modules (1 module per 1 tab). On top of that classes will be used to create dishes for menu tab and randomly choose 3 dishes for main page.
